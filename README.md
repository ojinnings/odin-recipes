First Project: Recipe HTML site


This is the first project in the Odin series. I used this project to practice my HTML and git skills. 

On this site you will find 3 recipes from my childhood that I still love to make today! The recipes are from my family, however the pictures are just from a quick google search and are NOT my own.

I was able to practice using anchor tags to navigate to each page of my site. I also used unordered and ordered lists, along with headers, paragraphs, and image components to create simple recipe pages. I practiced writing commit messages along the way to try to create a good habit. 

I know this site is not perfect, but I hope to return and make edits when I increase my knowledge of coding.

Thanks for reading!
